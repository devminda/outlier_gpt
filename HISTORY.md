# History

## You'd feed it a dataset (like a pandas DataFrame) and point to an outlier. The tool then automatically gathers context from surrounding data points and other columns, feeds this rich context into a large language model like GPT, and returns a set of plausible hypotheses (e.g., "Data Error," "Market Event," "Anomalous Activity") to explain the anomaly.
